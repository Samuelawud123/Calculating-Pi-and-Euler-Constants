# Calculating Pi and Euler Constants

## Overview

This repository contains a Java program that calculates and displays approximations of the Pi (π) and Euler (ℇ) constants. The program uses iterative methods to compute these values and demonstrates the convergence of the series for each constant.

## Coursework

This program is part of an assignment for a course focused on mathematical computations and programming. It involves calculating the values of Pi and Euler's constant up to a specified number of terms in their respective series.

## Files

1. **`Calculus.java`**:
   - Contains the main class that calculates and prints the values of Pi and Euler constants after a specified number of terms.
   - Key methods include:
     - `pi(int n)`: Calculates the value of Pi using a series expansion.
     - `euler(int n)`: Calculates the value of Euler's constant using a series expansion.
     - `factorial(int n)`: Computes the factorial of a given number.

## Usage

- **Compile and Run**: Use a Java compiler to compile and run the program. For example:
  ```bash
  javac Calculus.java
  java Calculus
